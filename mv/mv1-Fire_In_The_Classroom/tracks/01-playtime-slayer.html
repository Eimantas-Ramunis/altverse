    <section>
      <p>Morning started gently in most parts of town. Not here.</p>

      <p>
        Inside Willow Creek Primary, the hallways were already trembling with the nervous
        energy of small children and the tired resignation of the adults tasked with
        containing them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mara Quinn stood outside her classroom door, backpack slung over one shoulder,
        coffee cooling between her palms, watching her students gather like a slow-rolling
        tide. She wasn’t ready yet, not for the noise, not for the emotions, not for the
        swirl of contradictions that defined her days. But readiness had stopped being a
        requirement a long time ago. Showing up was enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cluster of children stood by the lockers, giggling as they compared keychains.
        Another pair argued in hushed voices over who got the dinosaur sticker.
        A girl sat cross-legged on the floor, humming to herself as she tied and retied
        her shoe. Two boys chased each other in looping circles, backpacks bouncing wildly.
      </p>

      <p>It looked harmless — even sweet — if you didn’t know what came next.</p>

      <p>“Mooorning Miss Quinn!” someone shouted, already too loud for the hour.</p>

      <p>“Good morning, Noah,” she replied, offering a smile that felt real for exactly half a second.</p>

      <p>She glanced at the clock. 08:07.</p>

      <p>Eight minutes to go.</p>

      <p>
        The trick, she’d learned, was to observe without absorbing. To treat the pre-class
        chaos like weather — unpredictable, but not personal.
      </p>

      <p>She sipped her too-cold coffee.</p>

      <p>
        A small hand tugged her sleeve. It was Lily, her smallest student, holding up a
        drawing of… something that looked like a melting dragon wearing a tutu.
      </p>

      <p>“Isn’t she pretty?” Lily whispered, eyes wide and hopeful.</p>

      <p>
        “She’s beautiful,” Mara said softly, kneeling to meet the girl at eye level. “And
        very… expressive.”
      </p>

      <p>Lily beamed, accepted the answer without question, and skipped away.</p>

      <p>08:10.</p>

      <p>
        The hallway noise thickened, rising in layers. Backpacks thumped. Velcro ripped.
        Voices bounced off the linoleum. Someone dropped a metal water bottle and it
        clanged like a warning shot.
      </p>

      <p>Mara’s chest tightened.</p>

      <p>
        She tried breathing the way her therapist once suggested — slow in, slow out —
        but all she tasted was the metallic tang of nerves and cheap coffee.
      </p>

      <p>She opened the classroom door.</p>

      <p>The horde surged inside.</p>

      <p>
        At first, everything moved in soft motion: coats dropped onto hooks, lunchboxes
        stacked, chairs scraped across tile. The children spoke in excited bursts, but
        still in a manageable range.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were not monsters. They were simply alive in a way adults forgot how to be.
        But their aliveness came at a cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        She set her coffee down. Straightened papers. Checked the attendance sheet.
      </p>

      <p>08:14.</p>

      <p>
        The energy shifted. Backpacks were abandoned in the middle of the floor.
        Pencils became drumsticks. Someone had already disassembled a pair of scissors
        into two separate, highly concerning pieces.
      </p>

      <p>
        A glitter bottle — uncapped. A paintbrush — dipped in something wet and
        definitely not paint. The classroom’s plastic storage bin labeled “QUIET ACTIVITIES”
        had been upended with ironic precision.
      </p>

      <p>Mara’s pulse climbed.</p>

      <p>08:15.</p>

      <p>
        The bell rang. It didn’t sound like a bell—not to her. More like a metallic
        klaxon, a shriek announcing that containment was officially required, and she
        was the only one expected to enforce it.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were everywhere now. On the rug. Under desks. Climbing—not metaphorically—onto
        shelves.
      </p>

      <p>“Alright everyone, settle—”</p>

      <p>
        A high-pitched screech cut her off. Something crashed behind her. Markers rolled
        across the floor like fleeing bullets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The volume snapped from “busy” to unbearable without passing through any middle
        stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room blurred into one mass of chaotic motion: two boys fought over a single
        orange crayon as if it were the last source of joy on Earth. A small girl sobbed
        because her unicorn sticker sheet had one sticker missing — the sheet she tore
        herself. Someone smeared glue across the whiteboard. Someone else was using a
        lunchbox as a drum. A third child managed, somehow, to get glitter into the
        ceiling fan.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fan turned. The glitter fell like radioactive snow.
      </p>

      <p>And Mara — Mara stood in the middle of it all, hands trembling, throat tight.</p>

      <p>
        She felt heat crawl up her neck. A shortness of breath she tried to swallow
        down. Her vision pixelated around the edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was not one moment. This was every moment she hadn’t processed, every day
        she’d held in her frustration like a breath she never got to exhale.
      </p>

      <p>Her voice came out louder than she meant:</p>

      <p>“Enough!”</p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t a scream. But it was sharp. Sharper than the room deserved.
      </p>

      <p>Silence hit the classroom like a hammer.</p>

      <p>
        Dozens of eyes turned toward her — some confused, some scared, some simply
        startled. Children rarely saw adults snap. When they did, the world bent in
        ways they didn’t understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mara’s stomach dropped. Her breath stuttered. <em>What have I done?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Her fingers curled. Her shoulders shook. The world felt suddenly too bright, too
        loud, too close.
      </p>

      <p>
        She forced the words out through a throat that felt raw.
      </p>

      <p>“Recess… early. Go. Please.”</p>

      <p>
        They didn’t question her. They filed out with unusual obedience, scattering into
        the hallway like startled birds.
      </p>

      <p>The door shut behind them.</p>

      <p>
        And Mara Quinn sank into her chair, heart pounding against her ribs, hands still
        trembling from the adrenaline.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the distance, another class’s bell rang. Children laughed. A teacher gave
        instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world kept turning. Even as hers tilted.
      </p>

      <p>
        She dropped her head into her hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        The glitter still drifted down from the ceiling fan. Tiny flecks landing on her
        desk, her sleeves, her hair.
      </p>

      <p>It looked like stardust.</p>

      <p>It felt like ash.</p>

      <p>
        She whispered to the empty room:
      </p>

      <p>“I can’t do this anymore.”</p>

      <p>
        No one answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only the soft hum of fluorescent lights, flickering like a warning she should
        have heeded months ago.
