    <section>
      <p>Mara didn’t leave her apartment with a destination in mind. She simply couldn’t bear to be still.</p>

      <p>
        The walls felt too close. Her thoughts felt too loud. And the ache behind her ribs — the one she had
        carried for years — throbbed with a familiar, merciless pulse.
      </p>

      <p>She grabbed her keys and walked out into the night.</p>

      <p>
        The city was washed in rain, still dripping from gutters, pavement shimmering under streetlamps. Her car
        sat alone beneath a flickering security light, raindrops jeweled across the windshield.
      </p>

      <p>She slid inside, shut the door, and exhaled shakily.</p>

      <p>No radio. No podcasts. Just the hum of the engine and her own breathing.</p>

      <p>She pulled out of the lot and let the city swallow her.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Downtown glowed in blues and purples, neon signs bleeding into puddles on the streets. She drove without
        thinking, letting her mind drift the same way her car drifted along the empty lanes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every now and then, the events of the day stabbed through the quiet — the glitter falling like radioactive
        snow, the stunned faces of her students, her voice echoing in the silent classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        But something else pressed in harder. Something deeper. Something older.
      </p>

      <p>The thing she never said out loud.</p>

      <p>
        The thing she pushed away every time she saw a toddler holding their mother’s hand, or a baby stroller in
        a grocery aisle, or a parent consoling a child in the schoolyard.
      </p>

      <p>
        She turned left instinctively, following a street she knew too well, passing the rows of shops and
        apartments until she reached the small, lonely park in the industrial district.
      </p>

      <p>She parked across from the swing set.</p>

      <p>
        The same swing set she sat on in the early days of teaching, before the exhaustion carved valleys under
        her eyes. The swing set she used to imagine bringing her own child to someday.
      </p>

      <p>
        The swing chains glinted with the last remnants of rain. One seat swayed slightly, touched by a gentle
        breeze.
      </p>

      <p>Her throat tightened.</p>

      <p>She killed the engine, leaned back in her seat, and stared at the swings until her vision blurred.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>The truth was a wound that never fully healed.</p>

      <p>
        Mara Quinn loved children. Not just teaching them. Not just managing them. She loved their wonder. Their
        messiness. Their tiny catastrophes and victories. Their unfiltered joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        And she always imagined — from the time she was small herself — that she’d have one of her own someday.
      </p>

      <p>But life had other plans.</p>

      <p>
        She learned at twenty-seven, sitting in a cold exam room, hands clasped so tightly her knuckles went numb,
        when the doctor quietly explained that a combination of factors meant pregnancy was unlikely. Very unlikely.
      </p>

      <p>The word felt like a fracture. A quiet shattering.</p>

      <p>She had held that fracture for years.</p>

      <p>
        She masked it with work. With routine. With the way children lit up around her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She mothered her students in a hundred unspoken ways. She gave them patience she denied herself. She gave
        them comfort she could not keep for long.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teaching wasn’t just a job. It was the only connection to the life she dreamed of but couldn’t have.
      </p>

      <p>And yet, the job had drained her dry.</p>

      <p>
        The universe had handed her a paradox so cruel it felt almost personal:
      </p>

      <p>
        You love children. You cannot have children. You are surrounded by children every day.
      </p>

      <p>Her breath hitched.</p>

      <p>She pressed a palm to her mouth to stifle the sob that rose unexpectedly.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>She watched the empty swings sway, faintly squeaking.</p>

      <p>
        A memory surfaced — picking up Lily’s paper crown from the rug earlier that week, placing it gently on the
        little girl’s head, the burst of joy in Lily’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>She could still feel the softness of Lily’s hair beneath her fingers.</p>

      <p>
        She wanted that. She wanted that life. A hand to hold. A child to guide. A future to shape.
      </p>

      <p>But it wasn’t hers. It never would be.</p>

      <p>A tear slipped down her cheek, warm against the cold of her skin.</p>

      <p>
        She whispered into the empty car:
      </p>

      <p>“I tried so hard to make peace with this. I really did.”</p>

      <p>Her voice cracked.</p>

      <p>“But today… today I just feel… broken.”</p>

      <p>The word echoed inside her like a confession.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        She looked out at the playground again. The climbing frame. The rubber matting. The mural fading on the
        brick wall — painted smiling faces peeling under the rain.
      </p>

      <p>
        A place meant for children. And she was staring at it from behind a windshield, a visitor looking into a
        world she wasn’t allowed to enter.
      </p>

      <p>She shut her eyes.</p>

      <p>Her breathing steadied. Slowly. Painfully.</p>

      <p>
        Then she turned the key again.
      </p>

      <p>The engine rumbled to life.</p>

      <p>
        She pulled away from the curb, letting the park shrink in her mirrors.
      </p>

      <p>
        She didn’t know where she was going next. Only that she couldn’t stay there anymore. Not in that grief. Not
        in that memory.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        As she drove back into the city grid, the neon lights returned. Cyan. Violet. Magenta.
      </p>

      <p>
        Colors that didn’t judge, didn’t expect, didn’t remind. Colors that simply existed.
      </p>

      <p>And in their glow, something small shifted inside her.</p>

      <p>
        Not peace. Not acceptance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just the faint suggestion that maybe — maybe — the life she wanted wasn’t the only life worth living.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe she could make something else. Something different. Something new.
      </p>

      <p>She didn’t know what that meant yet.</p>

      <p>
        But as she drifted through the neon haze, through the wet city air, through the quiet aftermath of her own
        private hurricane —
      </p>

      <p>she felt the first tremor of transformation.</p>

      <p>Something was ending.</p>

      <p>Something else was waiting.</p>

      <p>She wasn’t ready.</p>

      <p>But she was moving.</p>

      <p>And that was enough.</p>
