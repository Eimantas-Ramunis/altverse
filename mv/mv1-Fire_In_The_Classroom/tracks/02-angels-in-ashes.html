    <section>
      <p>The school day ended, but Mara didn’t feel the day end.</p>

      <p>
        She floated through the motions — dismissal, hallway duty, staff signatures, an
        obligatory conversation with a parent who didn’t notice her glassy eyes or uneven
        breathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her body was a machine performing tasks. Her mind was ash. Burned-out circuitry
        sparking in the dark.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she finally stepped into the empty staff room, the silence felt like a
        physical blow. The fluorescent lights buzzed lazily above the tables, casting
        long shadows over half-eaten yogurt cups, motivational posters, and a bulletin
        board full of reminders she hadn’t cared about in months.
      </p>

      <p>
        She sank into the nearest chair — the one with the wobbly leg — and let her
        hands fall open in her lap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her palms were trembling. Not from anger. Not even from fear. From release. The
        kind of trembling that comes after holding something too heavy for too long.
      </p>

      <p>A familiar voice broke the quiet.</p>

      <p>“You look like someone who needs… oh, I don’t know… a twenty-year nap.”</p>

      <p>She looked up.</p>

      <p>
        Jonas Hale leaned in the doorway, coffee mug in hand, tie loosened, shirt
        sleeves rolled up. He worked in the school’s small social services office —
        the one that was always understaffed, overworked, and expected to solve
        everything from bullying to existential crises.
      </p>

      <p>He looked at her with the sort of concern that didn’t need words.</p>

      <p>
        Mara tried to give him a smile. It came out crooked.
      </p>

      <p>“Rough day?” he asked gently.</p>

      <p>She laughed — a short, brittle sound.</p>

      <p>“You heard me.”</p>

      <p>
        “I heard the… tone,” he said carefully, sitting down opposite her. “Kids okay?”
      </p>

      <p>“Kids are fine.”</p>

      <p>It was her she wasn’t sure about.</p>

      <p>
        He nodded, like he understood anyway. He always seemed to.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You know,” he said, tapping his mug, “people assume burnout is a sudden thing.
        Like a power outage. But it’s more like corrosion. Slow. Quiet. Invisible until
        something snaps.”
      </p>

      <p>Her throat tightened.</p>

      <p>“Jonas… I think I scared them.”</p>

      <p>“You raised your voice,” he said softly. “It happens.”</p>

      <p>
        “No.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “I mean… I saw myself, Jonas. Like I
        wasn’t even there. Like I was watching someone else unravel.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His expression changed — not pity, not panic, but a kind of tragic recognition.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s not weakness,” he said quietly. “That’s a sign you’ve been strong for
        too long.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The words sat between them, heavy and shining like molten metal.
      </p>

      <p>She blinked hard, eyes burning.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t push. He didn’t pry. He just sat with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a while, when her breathing had steadied, Jonas stood.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Listen,” he said, gently tapping her shoulder. “You don’t have to decide
        anything today. Or tomorrow. Just… don’t carry this alone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked away, leaving her with the hum of the lights and the weight of her
        own exhaustion.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        She didn’t remember the drive home. Only the moment she parked and realized
        she was gripping the steering wheel so hard her knuckles had gone white.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sun hung low — not warm, not gentle, but a molten orange bleeding across
        the skyline, like the sky itself was on fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        She stepped inside her apartment. The air felt stale. She left the lights off,
        letting only the dying sunlight spill across the room.
      </p>

      <p>Then she remembered the envelope.</p>

      <p>
        The one she had stuffed into her work bag two weeks ago and never opened —
        labeled <em>“Teacher Wellness Survey — Mandatory”</em> in bold, cheerful letters.
      </p>

      <p>She pulled it out.</p>

      <p>Opened it.</p>

      <p>Read the first line:</p>

      <p><em>“How satisfied are you with your ability to manage daily classroom stress?”</em></p>

      <p>
        A laugh tore out of her — sharp, humorless.
      </p>

      <p>
        She dropped the paper onto the counter, leaned both hands against the cool
        surface, and let her head fall forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shower came next — still wearing her teaching clothes, still gripping her
        own forearms as the water poured over her. She didn’t turn it hot enough to
        soothe. Just enough to feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        She slid down to the floor tiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Water drummed on her head. Her eyes squeezed shut.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day replayed itself in vicious clarity:
      </p>

      <p>
        Children screaming. Markers exploding across the rug. Chairs scraping. Her
        own voice, louder than she imagined herself capable of.
      </p>

      <p>Her students’ stunned faces.</p>

      <p>Her shame.</p>

      <p>Her emptiness.</p>

      <p>Her exhaustion.</p>

      <p>
        She pressed the heels of her palms against her eyes, hard, until stars burst
        behind her eyelids.
      </p>

      <p>“Enough,” she whispered.</p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t a plea. It wasn’t a prayer.
      </p>

      <p>It was surrender.</p>

      <p>
        Surrender not to defeat, but to truth.
      </p>

      <p>She couldn’t keep doing this.</p>

      <p>
        Not one more week. Not one more day.
      </p>

      <p>Not one more hour pretending she was fine.</p>

      <p>
        She curled tighter, water mixing with tears she didn’t bother distinguishing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside, the sky fully darkened. Cars passed on the street below, their
        headlights slicing through the blinds in fleeting stripes of white and gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside, Mara felt like she was dissolving — like every part of her identity was
        turning to ash, drifting upward like smoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Every scar becomes a psalm,” the thought came to her — not poetic, not
        crafted, just instinctual.
      </p>

      <p>
        A strange calm spread through her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not relief. Not peace.
      </p>

      <p>
        A blankness that felt like the raw surface beneath something that had burned
        away.
      </p>

      <p>
        She sat up slowly, wiped her face, and turned off the water.
      </p>

      <p>
        The silence afterward was deafening.
      </p>

      <p>
        She stepped out of the bathroom, dripping, wrapped herself in a towel, and
        stood in the dimness of her apartment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything in her felt stripped down, laid bare.
      </p>

      <p>
        No defenses. No mask. No strength left to pretend.
      </p>

      <p>
        And in that fragile space — somewhere deep, beneath the exhaustion, beneath the
        grief — something small and bright flickered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not hope.
      </p>

      <p>Not yet.</p>

      <p>
        Just the first tiny spark of change.
      </p>

      <p>
        She breathed in.
      </p>

      <p>
        She breathed out.
      </p>

      <p>
        And for the first time in a very, very long time…
      </p>

      <p>She allowed herself to break.</p>
