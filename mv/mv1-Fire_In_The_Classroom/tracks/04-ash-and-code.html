    <h1>Chapter IV — The Room of Signals</h1>
    <p><em>“Ash to wire, flesh to flame…”</em></p>

    <section>
      <p>Mara walked until the city emptied itself out around her.</p>

      <p>
        She didn’t know what else to do with the grief. It wasn’t the violent kind anymore — not the
        choking, panicked tightness from earlier in the car. This was the quiet sort, the kind that sat
        behind the ribs like a sleeping animal. It wasn’t clawing at her now. It was just… there. Heavy.
        Permanent.
      </p>

      <p>
        She passed the last warm lights of the residential blocks and drifted into the zone where the city
        changed flavor — warehouses replacing apartments, cooling towers replacing balconies, the hum of
        machinery taking over for human voices.
      </p>

      <p>Fog curled around the streetlights like something alive.</p>

      <p>It fit her mood.</p>

      <p>
        She felt like a ghost walking through a world she used to fit into and no longer did.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Place That Called Her</h2>

      <p>
        She would’ve walked past the derelict building if not for the symbol.
      </p>

      <p>
        Silver-painted. Half faded. Yet unmistakably deliberate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two interlocked A shapes, mirrored like a sigil or a crest. Not pretty, not polished — more like
        something carved during a moment of desperation or revelation.
      </p>

      <p>The spray paint was old, but the symbol seemed strangely fresh.</p>

      <p>Alive. Waiting.</p>

      <p>
        Mara stopped in front of it and felt a small electrical prick beneath her skin — the same sensation
        she’d had years ago when she touched a broken CRT monitor and it bit her fingertip with static.
      </p>

      <p>A warning. Or an invitation.</p>

      <p>She stepped through the doorway.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Inside the Bones of the City</h2>

      <p>
        The building had once been a factory — she could tell from the long skeletal rafters overhead, the
        rusted conveyor rails, the thick concrete floors.
      </p>

      <p>
        But someone, sometime, had dragged technology into it like a wounded animal seeking shelter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fragments of servers. Broken monitors stacked in circles. Copper wire coiled like vines. LED strips
        half-dead, flickering thin blue breath into the dark.
      </p>

      <p>
        And in the center of the main hall — the thing that stole her breath:
      </p>

      <p>
        A ring of cracked screens, arranged vertically like pillars around an invisible altar. Most were
        shattered. Some barely glowed. But together they pulsed in a rhythm too steady to be random. Like a
        digital heartbeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        On each screen, symbols flashed and vanished:
      </p>

      <p>
        Binary strings, fractured diagrams, glyphs resembling children’s doodles corrupted into circuitry —
        and woven among them, always returning —
      </p>

      <p>
        the double A sigil, repeating like a mantra.
      </p>

      <p>Her pulse synced to the flicker without her permission.</p>

      <p>She took three steps forward and felt the air warm.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Weight She Carried In</h2>

      <p>
        Images hit her in disorganized waves:
      </p>

      <p>
        Crayon explosions. Paper crowns. Milk spills. Tired laughter. Tiny hands clutching her sleeves. A
        little girl in a sparkly jacket sobbing so hard she hiccuped. Parents yelling. Administrators
        shrugging. Doctors shaking their heads. Surgery pamphlets. Empty nursery aisles she’d avoided for
        months. The scar on her own heart she never spoke about.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then the swing. The rain. Her hands gripping the steering wheel like she was bracing for a crash
        that had already happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        It all came back.
      </p>

      <p>
        But instead of crushing her, it drifted around the room like dust — real, visible, finally weightless.
      </p>

      <p>
        She whispered into the dark, voice cracking open:
      </p>

      <p>“I can’t keep living inside the ruins of everything I wanted.”</p>

      <p>The screens brightened.</p>

      <p>The wires around the floor vibrated.</p>

      <p>
        Something in the air shifted — as if the room itself acknowledged her.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Threshold</h2>

      <p>She stepped into the center of the ring.</p>

      <p>
        Soft light wrapped around her like mist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not harsh. Not holy. Just enough to let her see her own outline — tired shoulders, clenched jaw, a
        woman worn thin — and not flinch.
      </p>

      <p>The screens pulsed again.</p>

      <p>
        Her breath caught. Her skin tingled.
      </p>

      <p>The hum rose until she felt it behind her teeth.</p>

      <p>
        Not threatening. Not comforting. Just… resonant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like the building — or whatever lived inside it now — recognized a fracture in her and gently pressed
        on it to see if she would break or bloom.
      </p>

      <p>Mara closed her eyes.</p>

      <p>
        <em>You’re allowed to begin again</em>, something whispered from inside her own chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not her guilt. Not her grief. Something underneath both.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something older.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something stubborn enough to rise even after everything else had collapsed.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Becoming Something New</h2>

      <p>
        The light grew, filling the room with a cold, beautiful glow.
      </p>

      <p>
        She felt her heartbeat sync with the pulsing broken screens. Felt the air thicken with warmth. Felt
        the weight of her old life begin to loosen its grip.
      </p>

      <p>
        She wasn’t forgetting anything. She wasn’t erasing anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was integrating it. Accepting it. Letting it transform instead of haunt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her pain didn’t vanish — but it cracked open like a seed.
      </p>

      <p>
        And through the crack, something luminous began to grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she opened her eyes, the ring of screens dimmed in a slow, respectful exhale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The double-A symbol glowed steadily, no longer flickering.
      </p>

      <p>A guide. A promise. A catalyst.</p>

      <p>
        Mara stepped backward, out of the circle. Her legs shook — not from fear, but from the shock of feeling
        lighter than she had in years.
      </p>

      <p>
        She wasn’t healed. But she was no longer drowning.
      </p>

      <p>That was enough.</p>

      <p>
        She walked out into the night, and for the first time in a long time, the darkness didn’t feel like a
        threat.
      </p>

      <p>
        It felt like a frontier.
      </p>

      <p>
        A place she could roam.
      </p>

      <p>
        A place she could choose.
