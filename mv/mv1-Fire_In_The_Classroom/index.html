    <h1>MV1 – Fire In The Classroom</h1>
    <p>
      A burned-out kindergarten teacher, Mara Quinn, walks away from the
      ordinary classroom and steps into a digital realm that was never meant
      to be a home.

      <h2>Story Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MV1 follows Mara Quinn, a primary school teacher worn thin by years of noise, need and a system that keeps asking for more. 
        One brutal day in the classroom cracks the shell she’s been living inside, sending her out into a rain-soaked city night that 
        slowly turns into a pilgrimage: through grief, old wounds, a derelict factory pulsing with strange signals, and a wired frontier 
        at the edge of town. By dawn, she hasn’t escaped her life so much as stepped across an invisible line, moving from collapse into 
        the first fragile shape of a self she chooses for herself.
